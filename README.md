# NumbPeg
These are the data and the RStudio scripts associated with the NumbPeg manuscript [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.28.569022v1). To use the scripts, the filepaths within the scripts should be changed to where the data were downloaded. Ensure that all necessary packages listed at the top of the scripts are installed.

If you want to use the raw MATLAB dataset, first install [Git LFS (large file storage)](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) which will pull down Exp1_raw.mat and Exp2_raw.mat when you clone the repo. Alternatively you can download the file directly. [Exp 1](https://github.com/YauLab/NumbPeg/blob/main/Data/Exp1_raw.mat) [Exp 2](https://github.com/YauLab/NumbPeg/blob/main/Data/Exp2_raw.mat)
